## Abstract
To update
Plastic pollutants are novel environmental stressors that are now permanent components of natural ecosystems. Endocrine disrupting chemicals (EDCs) such as bisphenols that leach out of plastics can modify physiological responses of animals by interfering with hormone signalling. Here we tested whether three commonly produced bisphenols, BPA, BPF, and BPS, impair thermal compensation of swimming performance and metabolic enzyme (citrate synthase [CS] and lactate dehydrogenase [LDH]) activities in adult zebrafish (*Danio rerio*). We found that exposure to 0.13 µM BPF and BPS, but not BPA, reduced swimming performance, and there were no interactions with acclimation (three weeks to 18 and 28 °C) or acute test temperatures (18 and 28 °C). BPA interacted with acclimation and acute test temperatures to determine CS activity, an indicator of mitochondrial capacity. BPS reduced CS activity, but there was no effect of BPF on CS activity. LDH activity reflects anaerobic ATP production capacity, and BPA and BPF altered the effects of thermal acclimation and acute test temperatures on LDH activity. Our data show that all bisphenols we tested at ecologically relevant concentrations can disrupt thermal responses of fish. BPS and BPF are used as environmentally safer alternatives to BPA, but our data show that these bisphenols are also of concern, particularly in thermally variable environments.
